## Hi!

My name is Vasilii Vadimov, currently I do theoretical physics at QCD Labs, Aalto University. My research interests include theory of open quantum systems, circuit quantum electrodynamics, and condensed matter physics.

I graduated High School of General and Applied Physics faculty at Lobachevski State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.
Being a doctorant at the Institute for Physics of Microstructures, Russian
Academy of Sciences, I did research on physics of superconductivity 
and defended my thesis in 2019. Then I moved for a postdoc to QCD Labs, Aalto University,
where I continue working at this very moment. There, I shifted my research
topics to open quantum systems and circuit QED.
