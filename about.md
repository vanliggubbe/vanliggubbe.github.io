I graduated High School of General and Applied Physics faculty at Lobachevski State University of Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.
Being a doctorant at the Institute for Physics of Microstructures, Russian

I defended my thesis in 2019 and moved for a postdoc to QCD Labs, Aalto University,
where I still work.
